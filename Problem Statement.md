## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India, has been a leader in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to rising competition and ineffective decision-making, the company is experiencing a decline in both market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel segments.  

To counter this challenge, the **Managing Director** has decided to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** into the companyâ€™s strategic planning. However, AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team to generate these insights.  

As a solution, the **Revenue Management Team** has engaged a third-party analytics service provider to analyze historical data and deliver actionable insights. The goal is to optimize revenue management strategies and regain AtliQ Grands' competitive edge in the hospitality sector.
